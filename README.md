# Slideshow Template

The Slideshow Template lets you to easily make a nice online slideshow. It is based the reveal.js framework which makes it easy to create beautiful presentations using HTML or Markdown. Check out the [live UCLA Library demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) and the [live reveal.js demo](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/).

This Slideshow Template is configured with UCLA colors and simple layout. However, it can be easily repurposed to meet your needs by altering the HTML or using the reveal.js framework's broad range of features (found at the [reveal.js github page](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/blob/master/README.md)).
